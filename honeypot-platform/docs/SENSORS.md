# Sensors

## Shared Contract
All sensors read common environment variables:
- `HOHO_PACK_ID`
- `HOHO_STORAGE_BACKEND=filesystem`
- `HOHO_STORAGE_ROOT=/artifacts`

All sensors append canonical events to `<root>/<pack_id>/index/events.jsonl` and write artifacts as content-addressed blobs.

## HTTP Proxy Sensor
- Built on mitmproxy reverse mode (`--mode reverse:<upstream>`).
- Captures request/response metadata and request body artifacts.
- Renderer joins proxy to attached service networks and applies fronting behavior:
  - Attached service published ports are removed.
  - Proxy publishes the same host ports to `listen_port` (default `8080`).

Runtime env used by renderer:
- `UPSTREAM` (required)

## Filesystem Monitor Sensor
- Watches configured directories for create/modify events.
- Applies allow/deny glob filters.
- Stores changed file content up to a cap and records preview text.

Runtime env used by renderer:
- `FSMON_WATCH` (comma-separated absolute paths)
- `FSMON_ALLOW` (comma-separated globs, defaults to `*`)
- `FSMON_DENY` (comma-separated globs)
- `FSMON_MAX_BYTES` (optional)

Important: fsmon cannot inspect a target container root filesystem directly. Watch paths must be backed by mounts shared with the fsmon sidecar.

## PCAP Sensor
- Uses tcpdump with rotation controls.
- Sidecar mode (`attach.service`) uses `network_mode: service:<target>`.
- Network mode (`attach.network`) joins the named network.
- Renderer adds required capabilities:
  - `NET_ADMIN`
  - `NET_RAW`

Runtime env used by renderer:
- `PCAP_ROTATE_SECONDS`
- `PCAP_ROTATE_COUNT`
- `PCAP_INTERFACE` (currently emitted, may be ignored by entrypoint depending on image implementation)

## Operational Notes
Disk usage can grow quickly from uploads and pcap segments. Use external rotation, retention cleanup, and dedicated storage volumes.
